                        professional settings. Effective verbal communication involves clear and concise language,
                        appropriate tone and pace, and active listening to ensure that the message is received and
                        understood by the intended audience.</p>

                    <h5><span><i class="bi bi-person-check-fill"></i> Nonverbal Communication: </span></h5>
                    <p>Nonverbal communication includes body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, and other
                        forms of nonverbal cues that convey meaning. Nonverbal communication can be just as important as
                        verbal communication, as it can convey emotions, attitudes, and other subtle messages that may
                        not be explicitly stated in words.</p>

                        interest and attentiveness.</p>

                    <p>Written communication involves the use of written words to convey a message, such as emails,
                        letters, reports, and memos. Effective written communication involves clear and concise
                        language, proper grammar and spelling, and an appropriate tone and format that is tailored to
                        the audience and purpose of the communication.</p>
