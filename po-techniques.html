                            Diversity and inclusion are key components of effective teamwork. Embracing differences in
                            backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences can lead to more creative solutions and better
                            outcomes.</p>

                        <p><span>Active listening:</span>
                            Good communication is essential for effective teamwork, and active listening is a critical
                            component of good communication. Techniques such as repeating back what someone has said or
                            summarizing key points can help team players ensure that they have understood what their
                            teammates are saying. </p>
                        <p><span>Delegation:</span>
