          </div>
          <div class=" experience-time-content">
            <p> Conflicts can arise due to a variety of reasons, some of which
              are:</p>
            <div class="subheading2_indent">
              <p>
                <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Differences in values:</span> Conflicts can arise when people have
                different values, beliefs, or
                opinions.
              </p>

              <p>For example, a conflict can arise between two co-workers if one believes in working overtime to finish
                a
                project while the other believes in maintaining work-life balance.</p>
              <p>
                <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Limited resources:</span> Conflicts can arise when there is a
                limited number of resources, such as
                money,time, or equipment.
              </p>
              <p>For example, if there is a limited budget for a project, a conflict can arise between team members who
                have different ideas on how to allocate the funds.</p>
              <p>
                <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Miscommunication:</span> Conflicts can arise when there is a
                breakdown in communication.
              </p>
              <p>For example, if a manager does not clearly communicate the expectations for a project, team members may
                have different interpretations of what is expected of them, leading to conflict.</p>
              <p> <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Personal issues:</span> Conflicts can arise due to personal
                issues, such as jealousy, ego, or
                insecurities.</p>
              <p> For example, a conflict can arise between two team members if one is jealous of the other's success or
                if one has a bigger ego than the other.
              </p>
              <p> <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Power struggles:</span> Conflicts can arise when there are power
                struggles, such as when one
                person wants to have more control or authority than others.</p>
              <p>For example, a conflict can arise between two managers who
                both want to be in charge of a project.</p>
              <p> <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Unresolved past issues:</span> Conflicts can be fueled by past
                issues or grudges that have not
                been resolved.</p>
              <p> For example, A co-worker constantly belittles another co-worker because they had a past disagreement
                that was never resolved.</p>

              <p> <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> External factors:</span> Sometimes, conflicts can arise due to
                external factors, such as changes
                in laws,regulations, or societal norms.</p>
              <p> For example, A group of citizens protests against a new law passed by the government that they
                disagree
                with.
              </p>
              <p> <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Cultural differences:</span> Conflicts can arise when people
                from different cultural backgrounds
                have different expectations or beliefs that clash.</p>
              <p>For example, A foreign employee is criticized by their American colleagues for being too direct and not
                respecting hierarchies.
              </p>
              <p> <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Goals and objectives:</span> When individuals or groups have
                different goals or objectives, it
                can lead to conflicts as each party seeks to achieve their own desired outcomes.</p>
              <p> For example, A group of politicians disagree on how to address a particular issue, with each pushing
                for
                their own objectives.
              </p>
              <p> <span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Organizational factors:</span> Conflicts can be caused by issues
                within an organization such as
                management style, policies, and procedures.</p>
              <p>For example, an employee feels discriminated against due to the company's policies that appear to
                favour
                a certain group.</p>
            </div>
            <p>It is important to identify the causes of conflicts in order to effectively manage them. By understanding
              the root causes of a conflict, it is possible to address them directly and find solutions that work for
              everyone involved. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="experience-time-content">
            <h5><span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Types of conflicts</span></h5>
            <div>


              <p><span><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Interpersonal conflict:</span>This is a conflict that arises
                between two or more
                individuals.</p>
              <div class="subheading2_indent">
                <p><span>Examples:</span>
                  Conflicts between co-workers or family members.</p>

                <p><span>Tactics:</span>
                  It's important to listen actively, communicate clearly and calmly, and seek to understand the other
                  person's point of view.</p>

                <p><span>Recommendations:</span> Practicing active listening techniques, learning how to give and
                  receive constructive feedback, and improving communication skills.</p>
