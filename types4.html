            <span><i class="bi bi-x-diamond-fill"></i> Conflicts can arise due to a variety of reasons, some of which
              are</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Differences in values: Conflicts can arise when people have different values, beliefs, or opinions.
                For example, a conflict can arise between two co-workers if one believes in working overtime to finish a
                project while the other believes in maintaining work-life balance.

              </li>
              <li>
                Limited resources: Conflicts can arise when there is a limited number of resources, such as money,
                time, or equipment.
                For example, if there is a limited budget for a project, a conflict can arise between team members who
                have different ideas on how to allocate the funds.

              </li>
              <li>
                Miscommunication: Conflicts can arise when there is a breakdown in communication.
                For example, if a manager does not clearly communicate the expectations for a project, team members may
                have different interpretations of what is expected of them, leading to conflict.

              </li>
              <li>Personal issues: Conflicts can arise due to personal issues, such as jealousy, ego, or
                insecurities.
                For example, a conflict can arise between two team members if one is jealous of the other's success or
                if
                one has a bigger ego than the other.
              </li>
              <li>Power struggles: Conflicts can arise when there are power struggles, such as when one person wants
                to
                have more control or authority than others. For example, a conflict can arise between two managers who
                both want to be in charge of a project. </li>
              <li>Unresolved past issues: Conflicts can be fueled by past issues or grudges that have not been
                resolved.
                For example, A co-worker constantly belittles another co-worker because they had a past disagreement
                that
                was never resolved.
              </li>
              <li>External factors: Sometimes, conflicts can arise due to external factors, such as changes in laws,
                regulations, or societal norms.
                For example, A group of citizens protests against a new law passed by the government that they disagree
                with.
              </li>
              <li>Cultural differences: Conflicts can arise when people from different cultural backgrounds have
                different expectations or beliefs that clash.
                For example, A foreign employee is criticized by their American colleagues for being too direct and not
                respecting hierarchies.
              </li>
              <li>Goals and objectives: When individuals or groups have different goals or objectives, it can lead to
                conflicts as each party seeks to achieve their own desired outcomes.
                For example, A group of politicians disagree on how to address a particular issue, with each pushing for
                their own objectives.
              </li>
              <li>Organizational factors: Conflicts can be caused by issues within an organization such as
                management
                style, policies, and procedures.
                For example, an employee feels discriminated against due to the company's policies that appear to favour
                a
                certain group.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to identify the causes of conflicts in order to effectively manage them. By understanding
              the root causes of a conflict, it is possible to address them directly and find solutions that work for
              everyone involved. </p>
