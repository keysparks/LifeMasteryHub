                    <p>Luna, the cat realized that she was feeling stressed and anxious when she heard the sound of the
                        vacuum cleaner. She analysed her behaviour and discovered that she was hiding under the bed to
                        avoid the noise. Luna practiced self-awareness and self-acceptance, recognizing that it was okay
                        to feel scared sometimes. She practiced self-compassion by comforting herself with a cozy
                        blanket and her favourite toy. Luna reflected on her fear and discovered that she felt more
                        relaxed when she was cuddled up in a warm spot with a view of the window. She developed a new
                        self-care routine by finding a cozy perch on the windowsill and watching the birds outside. Luna
                        felt proud of herself for being determined to find a solution to her fear and for practicing
                        self-discipline by sticking to her new routine. She regulated her emotions by taking breaks when
                        she felt overwhelmed and using her deep breathing techniques. Luna's self-esteem and
                        self-confidence grew as she realized that she could overcome her fear and find comfort in new
                        ways. She evaluated her progress by checking in with herself and noticing how much more relaxed
                        she felt during vacuuming time. Luna realized that she had discovered a new part of herself, a
                        brave and resilient cat who could face her fears and find new ways to feel safe and happy. </p>

                    <h5><span>Insights:</span></h5>

                    <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Self-awareness takes time and effort: </h5>
                    <p>Luna's journey towards self-awareness did not happen overnight. She needed to take the time to
                        reflect on her experiences, and she needed to put in the effort to change her behaviours and
                        thought patterns.</p>

                    <p>Seeking help and support is important: Luna's journey towards self-awareness was aided by her
                        interactions with other animals, such as the wise old owl and the empathetic dog. Seeking help
                        and support from others can be an important part of the process of personal growth.
                    </p>

                    <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Self-acceptance is key:</h5>
                    <p> Luna was able to grow and change because she learned to accept herself and her emotions. Rather
                        than denying or repressing her feelings, she learned to acknowledge and work through them.
                    </p>

                    <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Mindfulness is a useful tool: </h5>
                    <p> Throughout the story, Luna practiced mindfulness by paying attention to her thoughts and
                        emotions in the present moment. This allowed her to become more self-aware and make more
                        intentional choices about her behaviour.
                    </p>

                    <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Personal growth is an ongoing process:</h5>
                    <p> At the end of the story, Luna had achieved a new level of self-awareness, but she recognized
                        that her journey towards personal growth was ongoing. This is an important insight, as personal
                        growth and self-awareness are lifelong processes that require ongoing effort and commitment.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's important to note that understanding oneself is not always easy, and it can be a difficult
                        and sometimes uncomfortable process. However, the benefits of developing a deeper understanding
                        of oneself are significant, and can lead to a more fulfilling and satisfying life.
                    </p>

                    <p>These individuals have the required skills but lack motivation, so they may need encouragement
                        or support to fully apply their abilities.

                    <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Low Skill/High Will: </h5>
                    <p> These individuals have the motivation to complete tasks but may require additional training or
                        development to build the necessary skills.</p>

                    <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i> Low Skill/Low Will: </h5>
                    <p> These individuals may require significant support and training to complete tasks successfully,
                        and may also need motivation to become more engaged. </p>
