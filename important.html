          <p>Effective decision making is an essential skill for success in many areas of life. The ability to make
            well-informed decisions allows individuals to achieve their goals, solve problems, and overcome challenges.
            In personal life, good decision making can lead to better relationships, health, and well-being. In
            professional life, it can lead to increased productivity, profitability, and career advancement. In academic
            life, it can lead to better academic performance and improved educational outcomes.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, poor decision making can lead to negative consequences, such as wasted time and resources,
            missed opportunities, and even harm to oneself or others. Therefore, developing strong decision-making
            skills is crucial for individuals to navigate the complex and ever-changing world around them. By making
            thoughtful, well-informed decisions that align with their values and goals, individuals can achieve success
            and lead a fulfilling life.</p>
          <h5>Example</h5>

          <p>Let's say you are considering buying a new phone. There are various options available, such as different
            brands, models, features, and prices. Effective decision-making skills can help you choose the best phone by
            considering your needs, preferences, and budget. You can research the options, read reviews, compare
            features, and weigh the pros and cons of each option before deciding. By making an informed decision, you
            can ensure that you choose a phone that meets your needs and preferences, while also being a good value for
            your money. This is another example of how decision-making skills are important in day-to-day life, and how
            they can help us make better choices and achieve our desired outcomes.</p>

            make informed and thoughtful decisions.</p>

          <span>Factors affecting decision making</span>

          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Emotions:</h5>
          <p> Emotions can influence decision making by affecting our perception of information, biases, and
            preferences. For example, fear can lead to a bias towards avoiding risks, while excitement can lead to a
            bias towards taking risks.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Cognitive biases:</h5>
          <p>Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts or heuristics that can lead to errors in judgment and decision
            making. Common cognitive biases include confirmation bias, availability bias, and anchoring bias.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Personality:</h5>
          <p>Personality traits, such as openness to experience, conscientiousness, and neuroticism, can affect decision
            making by influencing our values, attitudes, and behaviours.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Environment:</h5>
          <p> The physical and social environment can affect decision making by providing cues, constraints, and
            opportunities. For example, a noisy or crowded environment can impair decision making, while a supportive or
            collaborative environment can enhance it.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Information:</h5>
          <p> The quality, quantity, and relevance of information can affect decision making by providing a basis for
            analysis, evaluation, and comparison. Lack of information or misinformation can lead to poor decision
            making.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Culture and values:</h5>
          <p> Culture and values can affect decision making by shaping our beliefs, norms, and expectations. For
            example, some cultures may prioritize individualism over collectivism, which can affect decision making in
            terms of autonomy, responsibility, and social norms.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Perception:</h5>
          <p> Perception refers to the way we interpret and understand information based on our senses and experiences.
            Our perception can influence our decision making by affecting how we evaluate and prioritize different
            options.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Priority:</h5>
          <p> Priority refers to the relative importance or urgency of different goals, tasks, or options. Priorities
            can affect decision making by helping us allocate resources, time, and attention. </p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Risk:</h5>
          <p> Risk refers to the potential for loss, harm, or uncertainty associated with different options or outcomes.
            Risk can affect decision making by influencing our willingness to take chances or make trade-offs. </p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Resources:</h5>
          <p> Resources refer to the tangible and intangible assets that are available to us, such as money, time,
            skills, and support. Resources can affect decision making by constraining or enabling our options and goals.
          </p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Goals:</h5>
          <p> Goals refer to the desired outcomes or objectives that we want to achieve. Goals can affect decision
            making by guiding our choices and preferences.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Demand:</h5>
          <p> Demand refers to the needs, wants, and preferences of others, such as customers, clients, or stakeholders.
            Demand can affect decision making by influencing our priorities and goals.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Judgment: </h5>
          <p> Judgment refers to the ability to evaluate and analyse information, make comparisons, and draw
            conclusions. Judgment can affect decision making by enabling us to make informed and rational choices.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Time:</h5>
          <p> The amount of time available to decide can impact the quality of the decision. Decisions made under time
            pressure may not be well-thought-out and can result in mistakes.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Impact:</h5>
          <p> The impact of a decision on the organization, stakeholders, and the environment should be carefully
            considered. Decisions that have a significant impact should be thoroughly researched and evaluated.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Output:</h5>
          <p> The output or outcome of a decision should be clearly defined and understood. Decisions that do not have a
            clear output can lead to confusion and uncertainty.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Effort:</h5>
          <p> The amount of effort required to implement a decision should be considered. Decisions that require a
            significant amount of effort may not be practical or feasible.</p>
          <h5><i class="bi bi-check-all"></i>Cost:</h5>
          <p> The cost of a decision should be evaluated, including both the financial cost and the cost in terms of
            time and resources. Decisions that are too expensive may not be sustainable.</p>
