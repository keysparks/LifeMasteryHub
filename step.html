                    <h5>Example: Steve Jobs' return to Apple</h5>
                    <p>In the mid-1990s, Apple was in a dire situation. The company had been struggling for years, with
                        declining sales, a confusing product line-up, and leadership struggles. In 1997, Apple's board
                        of directors made the decision to bring back Steve Jobs, the company's co-founder who had been
                        ousted a decade earlier.</p>

                    <h5><span>Step 1:</span> Identify the problem or decision to be made.</h5>
                   
                        <p class="subheading2_indent">The problem was how to turn around Apple's declining fortunes and revive the company's
                            reputation for innovation and quality.</p>
                  
                    <h5><span>Step 2:</span> Gather all the necessary information and data related to the problem or decision.</h5>
                    
                        <p class="subheading2_indent">The board of directors gathered information about Apple's financial and operational
                            performance, as well as feedback from customers, employees, and industry experts. They also
                            considered the strengths and weaknesses of potential candidates for the CEO position.</p>
                    
                    <h5><span>Step 3:</span> Consider all possible options and alternatives.</h5>
                    
                        <p class="subheading2_indent">The board considered various options, including hiring a new CEO from outside the company,
                            promoting an internal executive, or bringing back Steve Jobs.</p>
                    
                    <h5><span>Step 4:</span> Evaluate the pros and cons of each option.</h5>
                    
                        <p class="subheading2_indent">The board evaluated the pros and cons of each option, considering factors such as leadership
                            experience, industry expertise, and vision for the company. They also considered the
                            potential risks and benefits of bringing back Steve Jobs, who had a reputation for being
                            difficult to work with.</p>
                    
                    <h5><span>Step 5: </span>Make a decision based on the evaluation and choose the best option.</h5>
                    
                        <p class="subheading2_indent">After careful consideration, the board decided to bring back Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h5><span>Step 6:</span> Take action and implement the decision.</h5>
                    
                        <p class="subheading2_indent">Steve Jobs took immediate action to turn around the company, including cutting product
                            lines, reducing the number of employees, and focusing on developing innovative new products
                            like the iMac and the iPod.</p>
                    
                    <h5><span>Step 7:</span> Monitor the decision and its outcomes and adjust if necessary.</h5>
                    
                        <p class="subheading2_indent">Under Steve Jobs' leadership, Apple became one of the most successful and innovative
                            companies in the world, with products like the iPhone and the iPad revolutionizing the
                            technology industry.</p>

                    <p>This case study demonstrates the importance of effective decision-making skills in the success of
                        a company. By analysing the situation, gathering information, and carefully evaluating options,
                        the board of directors was able to make a strategic decision that had a profound impact on
                        Apple's future.</p>
