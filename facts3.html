          <span><i class="bi bi-x-diamond-fill"> </i>Summary</span>
          <p>Effective decision-making is a critical skill in both personal and professional contexts. It involves the
            ability to gather and analyse information, identify alternatives, assess risks, and make choices that align
            with goals and objectives. To make effective decisions, it is important to clarify the problem or
            opportunity that requires a decision and define the objectives and goals. Identifying a range of potential
            solutions or alternatives and assessing the risks associated with each one is also an important step.
            Evaluating evidence and considering the needs and perspectives of stakeholders can help in making informed
            decisions. Time constraints and personal values and beliefs can also impact the decision-making process.
            Tools and techniques such as decision matrices, SWOT analysis, and brainstorming can be helpful in
            structuring the decision-making process. Developing skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and
            communication can also support effective decision making. It is important to recognize that decision making
            is not always straightforward, and mistakes can occur. Strategies such as reviewing and adjusting decisions,
            seeking feedback, and learning from past experiences can help improve decision-making skills. Overall,
            effective decision-making is a continual process of analysing information, evaluating options, and making
            choices that align with objectives and goals.</p>
